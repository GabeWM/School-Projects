# School-Projects
### School Policy
Due to the University Of Marylands Computer Science departments school policy I am not allowed to publicly share my projects from my course work. To solve this problem (with permission of the school) I have made them private repositories and can grant access if requested from pontential employers (specific projects or all projects). Please feel free to reach out to me by any means.
